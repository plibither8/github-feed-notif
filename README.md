> :octocat::bell: Cross-platform, native, desktop notification service for notifying when personal GitHub dashboard feed gets updated with new activity

## About

github-feed-notifier (GFN) is a small NodeJS program that produces desktop notifications when your GitHub dashboard feed is updated with a new item. The program uses [node-notifier](https://github.com/mikaelbr/node-notifier), which allows for cross-OS support (Linux, macOS and Windows).

### Why

There are [quite a few](https://github.com/search?q=github+notifier) "feed notifiers" for GitHub, but most of them lack something that I want:

* Cross-platform compatibilty
* Configurability
* Desktop notifications (and a not browser notification)
* Easy installation

## Usage

### Installation

#### Requirements

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (and npm, of course)

Install GFN globally:

```sh
$ npm install -g gfn
```

and configure:

```sh
$ gfn config
```

Once properly configured, GFN can be run as a foreground process in your terminal: `$ gfn` or `$ github-feed-notifier`

### Configuration

The main requirement for configuration is your personal GitHub feed URL. You can obtain it by following these steps:

1. Login to GitHub and go to your dashboard (the [homepage](https://github.com))
2. Scroll down entirely, to the bottom of the feed (do not click the 'Load more' button)
3. Click on the "Subscribe to your news feed" link

![readme-subscribe-to-feed](assets/readme-subscribe-to-feed.png)

4. Copy the URL of this link. This is your personal feed URL
5. Run `gfn config` and paste this link

### Run as a Background Process

Though GFN can be run directly as shown above, it is meant to be run as a **background process** on your computer to prevent using an extra terminal session.

To start GFN as a background process, use [forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever), a simple CLI tool that allows a script to run _forever_, in the background.

To get started, install 'forever' globally:

```sh
$ npm install -g forever
```

Once installed, start forever:

```sh
$ forever start `npm root -g`/gfn
```

### Start Automatically on System Startup

This is where it gets different for different platforms, OS's and builds. I recommend looking it up for your own platform.

One possible, cross-platform solution is to use [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) instead of 'forever' to run the command forever, as pm2 lets you keep your process alive after every restart using [startup hooks](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2#startup-hooks-generation). But for a small project like this, pm2 might be overkill.

To get started, answers to questions on StackExchange worked for me, for [Linux](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12973777/how-to-run-a-shell-script-at-startup) and [macOS](https://superuser.com/questions/229773/run-command-on-startup-login-mac-os-x).
